## Creating new pages
- Create a new issue
  - Navigate to the [issues page](https://github.com/broadband-hub/help-pages/issues).
  - Create a new issue with the title "New page: <page name>".
  - Add comments describing what the purpose of the page should be and/or what the contents should consist of.
  - Assign the issue to yourself and optionally anyone else who is working on help pages (except @kylerummens).
  - Add the "documentation" label.
  - Add the "Broadband Hub Help Pages - Development" project.
  - Submit the issue.
- Create .md file
  - Navigate to the directory where you will create your page.
  - Click "Add file" -> "Create new file"
  - Name the file in lower-case, separated by hyphens (-), with the extension ".md". Example: creating-an-account.md.
  - Edit the file using Markdown.
  - When finished creating the Markdown, see the steps below to submit a pull request.
- Submit pull request
  - When ready to submit, name the commit "Created new page: <page name>".
  - Leave the commit description empty.
  - Change the submit type from "Commit directly to the main branch" to "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request".
  - Leave the branch name as-is (the branch name will probably be something like "kylerummens-patch-1".
  - Click "Propose changes"
- Link the pull request to the issue
  - Go back to the issue that you created.
  - On the right, click on the gear icon next to "Linked pull requests" and select the pull request you just created (the name of the pull request will be the commit title from the pull request).
- And you're done! The new page will be reviewed then pushed to production.
