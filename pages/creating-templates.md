Templates are a great way to easily filter your searches. Form 470 data, form 471 data and Entity data, all feature the Template ability.  Templates allow you to declare which fields you're interested in researching and limit your searches to prevent unncessary data from cluttering search results. Templates are saved to your account to allow you to quickly search the same queries.

Possible filters offered through Templates:
- Search term
- Funding Year
- Category of Service
- Region
- States
- Order
- Entity Types
- Allowable Contract Date
- Created Date
