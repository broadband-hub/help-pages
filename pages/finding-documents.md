Documents are listed for all Form 470 and Form 471s. These are USAC, FCC official documents linked to that Form's registry. Clicking on one of these documents will take you to its official USAC PDF on publicdata.usac.org. While the majority of this information is displayed in a more user-friendly manner in BroadbandHub, we offer this as a service to people who may want the official documentation and also as a way to view information that may not yet be included in BroadbandHub's information pages.
