#### Form 471s
Form 471s are organized by year. They declare services to be performed and all financial details of the service. The Form 471s page is a way to see all of the information about an entity's past 471 forms. 

There are three ways to view an Entitys' Form 471 data:
- Chart View
- FRN View
- Summary View

<br>

### Chart View
Chart View is the most visually-appealing way to view Form 471 data. Using Chart View, you can see details about each year's 471 numbers.\
<br>
Each year displays:
- The number of requests
- The amounts of money:
    - Original Request
    - Current Commitment
    - Total Disbursement
    - Remaining Balance
- Utilization percentage of the remaining balance

There are also three charts to more easily understand and interpret the data of each year's FRNs:
- Statuses
- Requested vs Committed
- Utilization

Hovering over each part of the graphs displays the specific number of each category. This makes it easy to see the different proportions in each category.\
<br>
To view specific information about individual FRNs, click the `View # FRNs` drop-down. This displays that year's individual FRN details similar to FRN View. Clicking on a FRN in the list creates a drop-down with that FRN's information and a link to its FRN page, where you can navigate to see more specific information about the FRN.

<br>

### FRN View
FRN View is a simple list way to view Form 471 data. It shows the basic information for each of the entity's Form 471s, organized by year.\
<br>
For each Form 471 you can see:
- Category of Service
- Status
- State
- Funding Year
- Service Type
- Service Provider
- Discount
- Total Cost
- Contract Expiration

Clicking on a Form 471 creates a drop-down that displays more information about that FRN. Clicking on a FRN in the list creates a drop-down with that FRN's information and a link to its FRN page, where you can navigate to see more specific information about the FRN.

<br>

### Summary View

<br>
For each funding year you can see:
