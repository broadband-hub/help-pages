The personalized Dashboard is one of the most useful features offered through BroadbandHub. The Dashboard allows you to view saved lists of Entities, Form 470s, and FRNs. After creating and populating lists, a map will appear on the right-hand side of each list on the Dashboard.  This map will automatically zoom to show all pin-points.
While using the application, you can save pages of interest by clicking on the `"Add to List"` button in the upper-right hand corner of the page. Clicking this button allows you to add the entity or form to a previously-made list or create a new list which will then be displayed on your Dashboard. This makes it easy to follow and return to pages of interest.

Click on a document to go to its details page.

Click and drag on the map to pan it around. Scroll to zoom in/out. Click on a pin to view information about that point.
